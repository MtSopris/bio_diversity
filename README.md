# bio_diversity

In this repo we look at Belly Button Biodiversity. This code includes a drop-down menu to select visualizations for the selected test subject. 
The code uses Ploty, D3, and JS to generate the visualizations form the data. 

The visualizations are as follows
A bar chart to display the top 10 OTU values
A display of the available metadata that includes the demographic information about the subject.
A bubble graph to display the quantity bacteria for each subject.
